# Regork-Customer-Analysis
Background:

Regork has entered the telecommunications market, offering services such as internet, phone, and online streaming.

Given that acquiring new customers is significantly more costly than retaining existing ones, our data analytics team needs to analyze customer data and develop a predictive model to determine if customers are likely to churn in the future. This will enable Regork to take proactive measures, such as offering incentives, to retain them.

Problem:

Customers tend to leave Regork Telecom within the first year of service, especially those who choose to pay through Electronic check or Mailed check on a month-to-month basis.
Short explanation:

In the analysis that follows, we examined customer retention data sourced from the “customer_retention.csv” file and developed a predictive model that performs well in forecasting customer retention.

Throughout the analysis, you’ll discover details on the required packages, data sourcing, and preparation steps. Additionally, an in-depth exploration of trends and relationships among predictor variables and the response variable precedes the development of the predictive model. We evaluated three classification methods: logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest. Our conclusions and rationale are highlighted within the summary section.

Proposed solution:

This model holds significant importance for various future analyses across different functional areas of our company. For instance, the marketing team could utilize it to strategize promotions for beginning customers who have less than 1 year of using service.

Summarize the implications

Insight: Customers who are more likely to leave the service exhibit certain patterns, such as having a short tenure, being on a month-to-month contract, having lower total charges and monthly charges, not utilizing online security, tech support, or online backup services, using Fiber optic internet, paying via electronic check, and not having device protection.

Retention Strategies Based on Tenure and Contract Length: Encouraging customers to commit to longer-term contracts (1 year, 2 years) can help reduce churn, as customers tend to stay longer when they have longer contracts.

Payment Method Influence: Customers who opt for bank transfer or credit card payments tend to stay longer compared to those who use electronic checks. Providing incentives to encourage alternative payment methods could help improve customer retention.

Retention Initiatives: Implementing retention initiatives such as discounted long-term contracts, promotional pricing for Fiber optic internet, complimentary online security and tech support, payment method incentives, device protection bundles, referral programs, and personalized offers can help retain customers and reduce churn.

The limitations and how could improve Further exploration into the timing of customer departures, such as by year or month, would be valuable for enriching our dataset and conducting more in-depth analysis on the reasons behind customer churn. While we have examined some factors, I believe delving into specific reasons for leaving, as well as customer satisfaction ratings, would offer a clearer understanding. This additional information would provide a more nuanced perspective on when customers are leaving Regork and the reason driving their decisions.
